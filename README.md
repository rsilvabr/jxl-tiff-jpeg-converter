# jxl-tiff-jpeg-converter

Batch converter for 16-bit TIFF exports → JPEG XL and JXL → JPEG/PNG, with ICC color profile preservation and full EXIF metadata correctly embedded and visible in IrfanView, XnView MP, and other applications.

## Why this exists

This toolset was developed to integrate JPEG XL (JXL) into a Capture One workflow, since Capture One does not export in this format natively.

**Why JPEG XL?** Spectacular compression with no compromise on bit depth.

- Lossless 16-bit files much smaller than TIFF and TIFF with ZIP/Deflate
- Lossy 16-bit files — small files that retain full 16-bit tonal information, something no other common format achieves (JPEG is 8-bit, TIFF lossless is large)
- This is genuinely new: small lossy files, but with 16-bit color depth

Here is an example of the gains when using JXL with 45MP Nikon Z7 files:

| Format | Typical size (45MP, 16-bit) |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| TIFF 16-bit | ~260 MB |
| TIFF 16-bit ZIP/Deflate | ~245 MB |
| JXL 16-bit lossless | ~173 MB |
| JXL 16-bit lossy `d=0.05` | ~47 MB |
| JXL 16-bit lossy `d=0.1` | ~34 MB |
| JXL 16-bit lossy `d=0.5` | ~13 MB |
| JXL 16-bit lossy `d=1.0` (visually lossless) | ~8 MB |

I am sharing these scripts because getting all of this to work correctly was unexpectedly difficult. The challenges were:

- Preserving 16-bit depth through the conversion pipeline
- Embedding EXIF so it is visible in IrfanView and other applications
- Correctly handling ICC profiles from Capture One exports (sRGB, AdobeRGB, ProPhoto RGB)
- Sync mode — reconverting only re-exported photos in existing folders
- Performance — RAM usage, parallelism, and staging to minimize I/O

Getting there required finding and fixing **six undocumented bugs** that only appear together in this specific combination of software (Capture One, cjxl, exiftool, IrfanView). Those bugs and their fixes are documented in [`docs/bugs_explained.md`](docs/bugs_explained.md).

## Requirements

**Python 3.12+** — https://www.python.org/downloads/
```powershell
pip install tifffile numpy
```

**cjxl / djxl** — https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/releases → `jxl-x64-windows-static.zip`
(`djxl` is only needed for `jxl_to_jpeg.py`)

Extract to `C:\tools\libjxl\` and add to PATH:
```powershell
$p = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $p + ";C:\tools\libjxl\bin", "User")
```

**ExifTool** — https://exiftool.org → rename the executable to `exiftool.exe` and add to PATH.

**ImageMagick** (for `jxl_to_jpeg.py` only) — https://imagemagick.org

Verify everything is working:
```powershell
cjxl --version      # JPEG XL encoder v0.11.x
djxl --version      # JPEG XL decoder v0.11.x
exiftool -ver       # 13.xx
magick --version    # ImageMagick 7.x
```

**Powershell** (for `jxl_to_jpeg_terminal` version) — Tested with PowerShell 7.6.0 version.

## Typical workflow

```
Capture One
    ↓ Export 16-bit TIFF (sRGB, AdobeRGB, ProPhoto RGB)

tiff_to_jxl.py      TIFF → JXL  (archive, stays 16-bit, lossless or lossy)
    ↓
    JXLs on disk — ~8–47MB each for lossy, ~173MB for lossless (45MP example)
    ↓
jxl_to_jpeg.py      JXL → JPEG  (when needed for print or delivery)
                                  ICC profile conversion applied here
```

---

## tiff_to_jxl.py — quick start

```powershell
# Mode 0 — flat folder: input → output
py tiff_to_jxl.py "F:\Photos\TIFF" "F:\Photos\JXL"

# Mode 5 — Capture One _EXPORT workflow (most common)
py tiff_to_jxl.py "F:\2024" --mode 5

# Sync — re-exported from Capture One? Only reconvert what changed
py tiff_to_jxl.py "F:\2024" --mode 5 --sync

# 16 parallel workers
py tiff_to_jxl.py "F:\2024" --mode 5 --workers 16
```

### Distance (quality) guide

Set `CJXL_DISTANCE` at the top of the script:

| Distance | Description | Typical size (45MP, 16-bit) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `0` | Mathematically lossless | ~173 MB |
| `0.1` | Near-lossless, imperceptible | ~34 MB |
| `0.5` | High quality — recommended starting point | ~13 MB |
| `1.0` | "Visually lossless" per libjxl docs | ~8 MB |

JXL lossy 16-bit retains full 16-bit tonal information, stored internally as 32-bit float. This is fundamentally different from JPEG, which is 8-bit only.

## jxl_to_jpeg.py — quick start

```powershell
# Basic — sRGB JPEG, quality 95, output in sibling folder
py jxl_to_jpeg.py "F:\2024\session\_EXPORT\16B_JXL"

# Rename ProPhotoRGB → sRGB in filenames
py jxl_to_jpeg.py "F:\2024" --rename-from "ProPhotoRGB" --rename-to "sRGB"

# AdobeRGB output (ICC profile path required)
py jxl_to_jpeg.py "F:\2024" --icc-profile "C:\icc\AdobeRGB1998.icc"

# 16-bit PNG (for print workflows)
py jxl_to_jpeg.py "F:\2024" --format png --bit-depth 16

# Preview without converting
py jxl_to_jpeg.py "F:\2024" --dry-run
```

### Output modes

| Mode | Result | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `0` | Subfolder inside JXL folder | `.../16B_JXL/jpeg-srgb/photo.jpg` |
| `1` | Sibling folder (default) | `.../session/jpeg-srgb/photo.jpg` |
| `2` | JXL folder name + suffix | `.../16B_JXL_srgb/photo.jpg` |

## Performance

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Workers | Value between CPU core count and thread count |
| `USE_RAM_FOR_PNG` | `True` — saves ~200MB disk I/O per file |
| Staging folder | Set to a separate disk from the TIFFs — avoids simultaneous read/write, much faster on HDDs |

## The bugs

Getting IrfanView to show EXIF in a JXL converted from a Capture One TIFF required finding six independent issues:

1. **cjxl doesn't read TIFF** — and ImageMagick silently downgrades to 8-bit sRGB
2. **Capture One ICC 2-byte rounding error** — bytes 68-79 of the illuminant field are `0x...d32b` instead of the spec-required `0x...d32d`
3. **IrfanView reads JXL boxes linearly** — stops at the codestream, never reaches the Exif box
4. **Lossy JXL uses multiple `jxlp` boxes** — naive reorder function collapsed them into one
5. **Brackets in folder names break exiftool** — `[FINAL]` is treated as a wildcard
6. **Windows doubles TIFF count** — `rglob("*.tif")` and `rglob("*.TIF")` return the same files

## IrfanView and color-calibrated monitors

JXL lossless files embed the ICC profile as a blob. Most software handles this correctly — GIMP, XnView MP, Darktable, Firefox, Waterfox, and `jxl_to_jpeg.py` all display correct colors.

IrfanView's behavior with lossless JXL appears to depend on the system display profile. In my testing, it worked correctly on an uncalibrated monitor. After hardware calibration with an Eizo monitor, IrfanView stopped showing correct colors for lossless JXL while continuing to show correct colors for lossy JXL. The likely cause is double color management — IrfanView applying both the embedded ICC and the system display profile simultaneously.

Lossy JXL (`d > 0`) uses native JXL color primaries instead of an ICC blob and is not affected by this issue.

If lossless JXL colors look wrong in IrfanView, use lossy at `d=0.1` (imperceptible difference, ~34MB for 45MP), or use any of the other viewers listed above. Files also convert correctly to JPEG using `jxl_to_jpeg.py`.
